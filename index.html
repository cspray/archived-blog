	Hi and welcome to <strong>"ramblings of a PHP enthusiast"</strong>.  My name is Charles Sprayberry,
	I'm an avid PHP programmer and a student in web-development at <a href="http://www.hvcc.edu/">Hudson
	Valley Community College</a> in Troy, NY.  I've been making websites as a personal hobby for 5 years
	and have been pursuing web development as a career for the past 2.  I whet my programming appetite at
	a former job with Visual Basic for Applications, have some basic experience with Java and JavaScript
	and have been focusing lately on PHP.  I love OOP, github and unit testing.  Clean code, well-written
	documentation, consistent coding standards and reusable, efficient algorithms make me giddy inside.
	Ugly code, poorly written documentation, no coding standards and duplicative code make me sad inside.</p>

	<p>Here I will discuss some ways I've turned my ugly code into elegant code.  Hopefully my problems and
	solutions will shed some light on your own coding ugly ducklings...and how to turn them into beautiful
	swans.  These little nuggets of wisdom are primarily targeted toward intermediate-level programmers
	who know the basics of PHP and are looking to start into some more advanced material.  Chances are
	if you don't know the basics about PHP 5.3 and OOP concepts, within the confines of PHP, you will not
	find this material helpful.  If you want to learn more about PHP basics I highly recommend you
	<a href="http://www.php.net/">check out the official documentation at php.net</a>.</p>

    <p>A lot of what I will talk about relates back to the work I have been doing on <a href="http://www.github.com/cspray/SprayFire/">SprayFire</a>.
    Most of my programming at the moment has been focused on planning, designing and implementing SprayFire.
    The project is currently still in development and open to new contributors.  Look over the <a href="http://www.github.com/cspray/SprayFire/wiki/">wiki</a>,
    <a href="http://www.github.com/cspray/SprayFire/issues/">issues</a> and the <a href="http://www.github.com/cspray/SprayFire/">source code</a>.
