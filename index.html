<p>Welcome to my blog about PHP, programming and web development.  Here I'll talk about my adventures creating my own PHP framework, <a href="http://www.github.com/cspray/SprayFire">SprayFire</a>, and some other ramblings that I vaguely connect with programming.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the content that you read here.  While I strive to make my articles as correct as possible I am human and do make the occasional mistake.
