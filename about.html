<p>As you have probably ascertained by now, my name is Charles Sprayberry and I write web software for a living and as a passion. I'm fortunate enough to really love what I do at <a href="https://designbook.com">DesignBook</a>. I live in a beautiful part of the country near Burlington, Vermont with my extraordinary wife, Dyana, and our two dogs, Nick and Kate.</p>

<p>While I've always taken to computer and the web in particular I didn't start programming professionally until 2012. Before that I worked in a monastery smoking cheese and fulfilling orders. I've worked in a teleconferencing center, managed a pizza place, and have been unemployed. <a href="{% post_url 2012-02-06-why-I-quit-school-what-it-would-take-to-stay %}">I'm a college dropout</a>.</p>
