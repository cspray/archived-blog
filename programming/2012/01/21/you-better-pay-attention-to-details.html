  <p>I like tea.  Particularly sweet tea.  When its cold give it to me iced; if its hot I’ll take it
steaming with a little bit of milk.  When its cold I tend to drink a lot of tea and I go through a
lot of tea bags.  Normally you wouldn’t expect to care too much about the <em>design</em> of a tea bag.
I mean, it is a little pouch of tea leaves that allows water to come in and out but keeps the tea leaves
in the pouch, with no leaves escaping.  There should probably be a string with some kind of handle to easily
retrieve the tea bag from hot water.  That about sums up the totality of a good tea bag.  So, when you
encounter a horrendously designed tea bag it really stands out.</p>

Ah, good ol’ Lipton.  If you drink tea in America you have to know this company.  They’re almost synonymous
with the stuff.  At first glance this product <em>appears</em> to take care of all the things required
in a good tea bag.  There’s a pouch there with some tea leaves and a string with a handle. But, look again.
At the top where they <strong>taped</strong> the handle to the tea bag.  That one crucial aspect
of the tea bag totally ruins everything else.  Why?  Because you have to use the most delicate touch
to remove the handle from the tea bag; otherwise the bag splits open and you risk tea leaves infiltrating
your water.  Tea leaves entering the water is the most egregious of tea-related offenses and is, quite
frankly, unacceptable.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-this-happen">how did this happen?</h3>

<p>My question isn’t why, I don’t really care why they decided to go with this design.  Maybe they
thought it was the best way to package the tea bag for individual sale, as I did purchase the offending
item at a service station.  Whatever the reason <em>why</em> I’m far more interested in the <em>how</em>?</p>

<p>Did they not <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/04/16.html">“eat their own dog food”</a> at all?
It isn’t like the tea bag splitting is a rare or uncommon occurrence, it happens quite frequently.
Frequently enough that <strong>I will no longer purchase Lipton products.</strong> Why would I waste
my money on a quarter of my tea bags getting thrown away unused?  Highly wasteful and inefficient.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-it-up">wrapping it up</h3>

<p>In conclusion you better damn well eat your dog food. Actually <strong>use</strong> the stuff that
you create and produce.  That applies to far more than just programming.  Use it.  Discover the weaknesses.
Fix the weaknesses.  Have a good product.</p>
