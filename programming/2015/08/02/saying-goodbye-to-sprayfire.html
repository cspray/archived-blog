<div class="post-content">
  

  

  <p>If you’ve read my blog before you know about a project I worked on called SprayFire.
It was my homebrewed framework. It taught me a lot about design patterns, the need
for modular libraries, and helped get me a job. Some time ago I deleted the project.
This post talks about why I deleted the project and what I’ve been working on
instead.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-had-to-go">why it had to go</h2>

<p>I started to use SprayFire and realized it had a critical flaw for how I like to
structure and build applications. I’ve come to believe that small, hyper-specific
libraries wired together is a better solution than a single, monolithic architecture.
There’s a lot of really great libraries already out there that do what individual
SprayFire components did, only better. It only makes sense to use them.</p>

<p>The project, while useful, simply wasn’t how I believe applications should be built
after lessons learned from experience. Instead of restructuring the framework for
what would be a 4th time I decided to start completely fresh. Instead of building
a framework I started writing specific libraries instead.</p>

<p>While SprayFire was an educational experience I also <em>want</em> other people to build
stuff with my work. Knowing that the project wasn’t something I believed in or
supported I removed it from GitHub instead of allowing it to exist. Sometimes
programmers can develop an emotional attachment with their code; no such attachment
existed here. The code didn’t serve its purpose and was removed.</p>

<p>I’ve went back through all my old posts that reference SprayFire and have removed
links along with putting up a disclaimer pointing out that the project doesn’t exist.</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-been-up-to">what I’ve been up to</h2>

<p>Besides work-related coding, which has taken over more of the time I spend developing
software, I still contribute to other open source projects and write my own
libraries. Some of the cooler things include:</p>
