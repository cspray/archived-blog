<p>As I mentioned before my name is Charles and I live in the Capital Region of New York State.  I moved
to the area in the summer of 2009, after having spent over 15 years in Alabama.  I was drawn to the area
by a job with the <a href="http://www.newsketemonks.com/">Monks of New Skete</a> and my beautiful fiancee,
Dyana.  I'm currently attending college and eagerly await entry into the professional web development
industry after graduation.</p>
