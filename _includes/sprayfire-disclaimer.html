  <p>This post talks about an old, dead project, SprayFire; you can <a href="{% post_url 2015-08-02-saying-goodbye-to-sprayfire %}">read about it's demise</a>. To make a long story short, SprayFire has been replaced with <a href="https://github.com/cspray/labrador">Labrador</a> and a different philosophy on app development. All links to SprayFire have been removed.</p>
