<h2>I moved</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in <a href="">one of my previous posts</a> I got a job.  The job just so happened
to necessitate moving.  Needless to say I've been busy the past couple weeks.  My fiancee and I are
finally somewhat settled into our apartment and I'm starting to get back into the swing of things.
I really want to get some progress made on SprayFire and am looking forward to some good progress in
the coming weeks.</p>

<p>I've also been spending some time working with <a href="https://www.trello.com/">Trello</a> and I'm
really starting to like the tool.  I've been working on getting my ideas into Trello and start using
the site as part of my normal workflow.  I have a couple boards there, <a href="https://trello.com/board/personal-projects/4f48246c6bfefa2d6b26bf0f">one of which is free
to peruse</a>.  You can see some of the open-source projects I have in the pipeline and a general feel
for what I'm working on at any given time.</p>

<p>Of course with a new job the amount of time I'll have to spend on these projects is likely to be
limited as compared to the dark days of unemployment.</p>

<p>I also have some big plans for the blog.  Adding some more content and changing the design is definitely
high on the list.  I'm also working on my next article dealing with SprayFire in which I'll be talking
about how I'll be implementing a Dependency Injection Container strategy to be used by both the framework
and the apps being used by the framework.  Hopefully I'll have that up by this weekend.</p>

<p>Mostly just wanted to let everybody know the blog is still active and there's some more content coming.
I just moved.</p>
