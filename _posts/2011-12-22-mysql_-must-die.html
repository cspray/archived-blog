<h2><code>mysql_*</code> must die</h2>

<h3>introduction</h3>

<p>PHP and MySQL go together like cookies and milk, apple and pie, summer and barb...well, you get the
idea.  PHP is so entertwined with <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">Oracle's open-source database system</a> 
that entire books are devoted to their relationship with one another.  Tutorials abound on how to make 
the most basic, rudimentary database calls imaginable.  Unfortunately the majority of these references 
are outdated and, while not necessarily promoting bad practices, aren't exactly encouraging good practices.</p>
