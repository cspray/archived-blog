<h2>writing better commits with github</h2>

<blockquote>
Wait, you don't use <a href="http://www.github.com/">github</a>?  What, do you live under
a rock or something?  Seriously, check out this great social-coding site!  Offers you a place to store,
share and track your source code using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>!

<p>As the development of <a href="http://www.github.com/cspray/SprayFire/">SprayFire</a> progresses
I'm constantly evaluating what I'm doing, how I'm doing it and what tools I'm using.  Lately I've been
thinking about the way I use <strong>git</strong>, my version control software of choice.  Looking
through some of the commits for SprayFire I can tell that my commit strategy needs some work.  Commit
messages are sometimes length or don't really convey what the commit is doing.  What are some things
that I can do to improve my commits and make for a more maintainable project?</p>

<h3>commit, commit, commit</h3>
<p>Well, the first thing is to simply commit more often.  Too often I find myself making a series of
small refactors and never commiting my changes between refactors.  Next thing I know I've found myself
making a single commit where the entire file has changed and instead I should have made three or four
smaller commits changing a fragment of the file at a time.</p>
<p>While small, simple classes can make this easy to get away with it can bite you when your classes
become more complex.  It is important to establish a "muscle memory" if you will.  What you do with
your small, simple classes will wind up translating over into the bigger, complex classes.  If you
<em>always</em> commit early and often then you never wind up finding yourself refactoring an entire file
between commits.</p>
